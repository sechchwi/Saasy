Feature: display list of verses sorted by category
As an user
So that I can view only a specific range of Bible verses
I want to be able to sort Bible verses by Category

Background: movies have been added to database
Given the following movies exist:
| title | rating | release_date|
| 2 Corinthians 5:17  | Christ the Center| Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, he has become a new creaton. The old has passed away; behold, the new has come. |
| Romans 3:23 | Proclaim Christ | for all have sinned and fallen short of the glory of God |
|Matthew 6:33 | Being Christ's Disciple | But seek first the kingdom of God and his righteousness, and all these things will be added to you. |
| John 13: 34-35  | Grow in Christlikeness| A new commandment I give you, that you love one another: just as I hve loved you, you are to love one another. By this, all people will know you are my disciples, if you have love for one another. |
